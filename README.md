# rotatory-error-detection
The project is detect errors in rotatory electrical machines like Induction motors. We have simulated the Induction motor in simulink and collected the healthy and faulty dataset using MATLAB. Time-series signal responses (voltage, current, and load) were simulated under varying noise and operating conditions. There are 384 samples of healthy and 100 samples with 10 ohm fault 100 with 30 ohm falut and 100 of 60 ohm fault. 



The final results obtained are 86% of cross validation accuracy with SVM and 91% with Random Forest.
